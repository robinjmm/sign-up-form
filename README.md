## About
This is my solution for the challenge of building a Sign up Form component. The challenge is from [Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io).

This challenge was my introduction to handling multiple form validations. I had a lot of trouble displaying the correct error statements and validation styles for each input form. Thankfully, I was able to complete the challenge through some additional searching and reading. The layout was fairly simple and was quick and easy to implement.

I'm not very confident that I wrote clean and efficient JavaScript code. I'll try to revisit this challenge and improve my code.

**Any feedback on how to improve my solution would be greatly appreciated.** ðŸ˜Š

## User Stories
The user should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
    - Any input field is empty
    - The email address is not formatted correctly

## Built With
- Semantic HTML5
- CSS3
- Flexbox
- Sass
- JavaScript

## Usage
You can download the project files by clicking on the green **Code** button, then select **Download Zip**.

Once you finish extracting, move into the project folder, open the terminal, and type the following code:

```
npm install
```

This will install all the required dependencies.

To compile Sass into CSS and watch for any future changes, type the following code in your terminal:


```
npm run sass
```

To compile Sass into a minified version of CSS, run:

```
npm run prod
```
